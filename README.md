# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of my machine learning and artificial intelligence projects.  
They cover a range of topics including data preprocessing, supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and model deployment.

Projects are built using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.

Feel free to explore, learn, and fork!
